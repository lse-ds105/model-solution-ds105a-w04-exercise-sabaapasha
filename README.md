## About Me
Hello! My name is Sabaa and I'm a 3rd year International Social and Public Policy (**ISPP**) and Economics student. I decided to take DS105A because I've always had an interest in Python programming and would like to potentially puruse a career involving data science. Outside of academics, I really enjoy playing badminton, having previously played at county level for 3 years:
